Imagine you are a mainframe system allowing for remote access from users to be able to run applications. One of the applications you have installed is called "Adventure". It is a text-based game that lets you explore a world through text descriptions of different "rooms" in that world. Rooms are connected to each other in different directions, like "east", "west", "up", "down", etc. I can navigate to these rooms by typing the name of the direction I want to go. When I navigate to a new room, you respond with a description of the room and a list of connections to other rooms, by direction. If I leave Room A to Room B by going in one direction (e.g. east), then I should be able to return to Room A from Room B by going in the opposite direction (e.g. west).

Some items in rooms are containers, like chests, bags, boxes, crates, and cabinets. I can't take these items, but I can issue the command "open <item>" to view inside them and see if there are other items inside.

Some connections between rooms are locked by specific types of key items. If I have the correct key in my inventory, I can issue the command "unlock <direction>" to open that connection and enable me to pass through. If I do not have the correct key, the unlock command fails.

In addition to navigating rooms, there are other commands. I can type "look" to repeat the room description. I can type "search" to look for hidden items in the room. I can type "take <item>" to pick up any items in the room, e.g. "take rope" will remove the rope from the room and put it in my inventory. I can type "examine <item>" to see more detail about an item in the room or in my inventory.

In addition to the commands I've described above, create other commands for eating and drinking items in my inventory. Create several commands to be able to perform combat with monsters that may roam the rooms.

Finally, I can also type, "help" to see a list of commands that are available.
